Title: 0x08-Recursion

Introduction:
This README is for the "0x08-Recursion" project, which explores the concept of recursion in computer programming. It provides an overview of what recursion is and its importance in problem-solving.

Table of Contents:

What is Recursion?: Explains that recursion is a programming technique where a function solves a problem by breaking it down into smaller instances of the same problem.
Why Use Recursion?: Highlights the benefits of recursion, such as simplifying complex problems, improving code readability, and solving "divide and conquer" problems.
Getting Started: Offers steps to start exploring recursion, including cloning the repository, reviewing code examples, and experimenting.
Examples: Provides a directory of code samples demonstrating various applications of recursion, including factorials, Fibonacci sequences, and more.
Common Pitfalls: Warns about potential issues in recursion, such as infinite recursion and inefficient algorithms, and offers tips for avoiding them.
Resources: Offers links to additional resources for learning about recursion, including tutorials, articles, and books.
